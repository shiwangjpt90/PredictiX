## Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure sign-up and login functionality with protected routes using Context API.
- **Predictive Models:**
  - Heart disease prediction using Logistic Regression.
  - Diabetes prediction using Support Vector Machine (SVM).
  - Breast cancer prediction using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
  - Lung cancer prediction using the InceptionResNet model.
- **Image Upload for Cancer Predictions:** Users can upload medical images for breast and lung cancer detection.

- **Custom PDF Reports:** Generate a downloadable PDF report of prediction results.
- **Real-time Notifications:** Integrated React Toasts for user-friendly notifications.
- **Single Server Deployment:** Node.js Child Process is used to run all models, eliminating the need for a separate Flask server.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React JS (with Vite), Context API, React Toasts, Figma for design.
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, Node.js Child Process for running machine learning models.
- **Database:** MongoDB (for user data and predictions).
- **Machine Learning Models:** Logistic Regression, SVM, CNN, InceptionResNet.
- **Other Libraries:** 
  - `pdf-lib` for generating custom PDF reports.
  - `multer` for file uploads (images and prescriptions).
  - `concurrently` for running client and server simultaneously.

## Machine Learning Models

- **Heart Disease Prediction:**
  - Algorithm: Logistic Regression.
  - Input Features:
    - Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type, Resting Blood Pressure, Serum Cholesterol, Fasting Blood Sugar, ECG Results, Max Heart Rate, Exercise Induced Angina, ST Depression, Peak ST Slope, Number of Vessels, Thalassemia.

- **Diabetes Prediction:**
  - Algorithm: Support Vector Machine (SVM).
  - Input Features:
    - Pregnancies, Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin, BMI, Diabetes Pedigree Function, Age.

- **Breast Cancer Prediction:**
  - Algorithm: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).
  - Input: Breast tissue image.

- **Lung Cancer Prediction:**
  - Algorithm: InceptionResNet.
  - Input: Lung X-ray or CT scan image.

## Usage

1. **Sign up** or **Log in** to access the predictors.
2. Navigate to the respective disease predictor (Heart, Diabetes, Breast, Lung).
3. **For heart disease and diabetes:** Fill in the form manually or upload a prescription, and the system will auto-populate the fields using regex.
4. **For breast and lung cancer:** Upload an image (X-ray or CT scan).
5. Submit the form and view the prediction result.
6. Download the custom PDF report for future reference.

## Frontend Design

The frontend design has been created using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/psQyNMetXUsjCcvmvvjqIg/PredictiX---Final-Year-Project?node-id=0-1&t=KuA0zys1uwoHgMxW-1). It outlines the structure and user flow of the application, ensuring a seamless user experience.
